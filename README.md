## üëã Getting started

Welcome to trophoria! If you want to look how we implemented the application or even want to contribute to it, you are absolutely in the right place. This is out main repository which contains the backend and frontend implementations.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Important
>
> If you want to contribute to our community projects, we advice you to fist read through our wiki pages because there we describe things like: setting up the dev > environment, which technologies we used and how open source even works on GitHub. Also this repository itself contain more useful information like pull request templates, security guidelines and so on. Make sure to read those too (inside the .github folder)! And now, happy coding! üéâ

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

To setup the dev environment, you need to make sure to have the following tools installed on your system first. Keep in mind, that bun can only be installed on Linux based systems for the time being. If you are on windows, make sure you setup this repository inside of wsl2.

- [docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Needed for development containers (database)
- [bun](https://bun.sh/) - Fast and modern JavaScript runtime environment
- (optional) [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) - If you decide to not install it, you have to type in every command you want to use from `Taskfile.yml` files manually in your command line. It is encouraged to use this utility.

You can install all the dependencies of the projects with this simple command: task run -- install. If you don't want to install all dependencies of all projects, navigate to the desired one and run bun install.

This repository uses environment files to store secret credentials like api tokens, crypto keys or database passwords. Create the following files by copying the matching `.env.template` file and fill the empty spaces and/or adjust the other values as you like.

- `backend/app/.env.development`

Now we have to setup all needed background services like databases with the `task setup` command.

If all services are ready, you can now move on to start the actually backend development server inside the `backend/app` directory with `bun start`.
