# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

If you want to self host this service, we advice you to always update to the latest versions. However here you can find the versions we support with general security updates. Never use a version in production, which is no longer supported, and if you do so, you do it on your own risk.

| Version | Supported          |

| 0.0.0   | :white_check_mark: |
