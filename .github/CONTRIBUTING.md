# Contributing to our Community Projects

A big welcome and thank you for considering contributing to our open source projects! Your help is essential for keeping it great.

The goal of this document is to create a contribution process that:

- Encourages new contributions.
- Encourages contributors to remain involved.
- Sets up a development environment.
- Avoids unnecessary processes and bureaucracy whenever possible.

Reading and following these guidelines will help us make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved. It also communicates that you agree to respect the time of the developers managing and developing these open source projects. In return, we will reciprocate that respect by addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Code of Conduct

We take our open source community seriously and hold ourselves and other contributors to high standards of communication. By participating and contributing to this project, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). You can read more about this in our [Fork & Pull Request Workflow](wiki/pull_request_workflow.md) wiki page. A few general guidelines that cover both:

- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- We work hard to makes sure issues are handled in a timely manner but, depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the root cause. A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can help draw attention if your issue is blocking.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the project, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.

If you just have questions (for example about the code), please ask it in the discord server before opening an issue.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a reaction can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.

### Pull Requests

PRs to our projects are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Include documentation in the repo.
- Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created).

Please keep in mind that we use ESLint & Prettier to enforce a consistent coding style, so having that set up in your editor of choice is a great boon to your development process. If you want to learn, how we set up our development environment, you can read our [Development setup](https://github.com/trophoria/.github/wiki/2-Development-setup) wiki page.

At last, keep an eye on the [Contribution Checklist](https://github.com/trophoria/.github/wiki/4-Contribution-checklist) which summarizes this document with additional code style checklists, to enforce the code quality. This checklist is also included in the templates.
